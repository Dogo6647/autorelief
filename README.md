# autorelief
A (very) simple script that adds autosaving capability to apps that don't support it.

## Installing/building
Installing autorelief is pretty straightforward.
First, you'll need to clone the repository, then run:

```
cd autorelief/build
```

and

```
sh build.sh
```

The GitUnite builder will walk you through the building process,
simply type in your platform (if available on the list) and press Enter.

```
debian-ubuntu
```

The building process should finish almost instantly. After the building process
finishes, you can run autorelief by typing

```
autorelief
```

or

```
autorelief-config
```

if you wish to configure Autorelief.
