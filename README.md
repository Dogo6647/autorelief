# autorelief
A (very) simple script that adds autosaving capability to apps that don't support it.

## Installing/building
Installing autorelief is pretty straightforward.
First, you'll need to clone the repository, then run:

```
cd autorelief/build
sh build.sh
```

### Building: Last step
The GitUnite builder will walk you through the building process,
simply type in your platform (if available on the list) and press Enter.

```
debian-ubuntu
```

## Running Autorelief
The building process should finish almost instantly. After the building process
finishes, you can run autorelief by running

`autorelief` or `autorelief-config`

if you wish to configure Autorelief.
